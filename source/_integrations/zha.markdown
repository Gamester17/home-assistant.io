[Zigbee Home Automation](https://zigbee.org/zigbee-for-developers/applicationstandards/zigbeehomeautomation/)
integration for Home Assistant allows you to connect many off-the-shelf Zigbee based devices to Home Assistant using one of the many Zigbee radio adapters/modulse that is compatible with [zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy), an open source Python library implementing a Zigbee stack, (zigpy in turn depends on separate open source Python libraries to interface with Zigbee radio hardware from different manufacturers).

Being a native integration in Home Assistant means that it uses its official user-interfaces and front-ends, and it is therefor also very simple to get started with. As it is a built-in components means that it and its interfaces are automatically updated with Home Assistant. There is no list of supported devices, as any devices compliant Zigbee Home Automation standard should work. Adding support for not working devices via ZHA Device Handlers is documented.

This integration currently has support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary Sensor
- Cover
- Fan
- Light
- Lock
- Sensor
- Switch

## What is Zigbee Home Automation?
Zigbee Home Automation is a wireless communication protocol specification designed for personal area networks that is well suited to low-cost home automation devices. With the exception that Zigbee Home Automation operates within the unlicensed 2.4 GHz band worldwide, it is similar to the Z-Wave protocol in the wat that it also uses low-power and low-bandwidth digital radio to build a mesh-network that allows devices that are not in direct range of each other to communicate indirectly, via other nodes that uses the same Zigbee protocol specification.

Your main Zigbee radio module/adapter act as a "coordinator" in your mesh-network and many permanently powered Zigbee devices that are not battery powered will as such act as "routers" to help extend the mesh-network. Battery powered devices and other devices which do not act as routers are called "end devices", (Zigbee light bulbs are for example likley to act as an "end device" even though they are permanently powered). If you do not have enough routers or you locate your routers poorly then your Zigbee mesh-network can become unreliable.

Before buying any Zigbee hardware you should be aware that each device model as well as the "coordinator" hardware in your mesh-network may also be deliver better or worse radio range than other device models. Also, while the hard limit of a single Zigbee mesh-network is some 65 thousand devices, Zigbee radio modules/adapters hardware from different manufacturers will different recommendations on how many routers that you can actually directly connect to it and how many that you can indirectly connect to their mesh-network as in total.

Zigbee devices generally cost much less than similar Z-Wave devices, which is mainly due to all Z-Wave having to go though a certification process which is meant to make sure that all Z-Wave work togther for a uniformed intercompatible. Historically relying on compatibility between devices has not with Zigbee has not been the case, this has however gotten much better in modern Zigbee stacks and integration implementations, like ZHA in Home Assistant. Neither Zigbee or Z-Wave can be said to be universally better than the other as both technologies have different advantages and disadvantages over each other.

In practice there is today no need to worry to much as most Zigbee mesh-network issues can be solved by relative simple toubleshooting. There are reports of Zigbee mesh-networks containing many several hundreds of devices that perform well, and many times toubleshooting can some times be as simple as making sure you have your "routers" that provide good range / radio strenght directly corrected to your "coordinator" as well as having your "end devices" connected to your best "routers".

## Configuration - GUI

From the Home Assistant front page go to **Configuration** and then select **Integrations** from the list.

Use the plus button in the bottom right to add a new integration called **ZHA**.

In the popup:

  - USB Device Path - on a linux system will be something like `/dev/ttyUSB0`
  - Radio type - select device type **ezsp**, **deconz** or **xbee**
  - Submit

The success dialog will appear or an error will be displayed in the popup. An error is likely if Home Assistant can't access the USB device or your device is not up to date (see troubleshooting).

## Configuration - Manual

To configure the component, select ZHA on the Integrations page and provide the path to your Zigbee USB stick.

Or, you can manually confiure `zha` section in `configuration.yaml`. The path to the database which will persist your network data is required.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
zha:
  usb_path: /dev/ttyUSB2
  database_path: /home/homeassistant/.homeassistant/zigbee.db
```

If you are use ZiGate, you have to use some special usb_path configuration:
  - ZiGate USB TTL or DIN: `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `auto` to auto discover the zigate
  - PiZigate : `pizigate:/dev/serial0`
  - Wifi Zigate : `socket://[IP]:[PORT]` for example `socket://192.168.1.10:9999`

{% configuration %}
radio_type:
  description: One of `ezsp`, `xbee`, `deconz` or `zigate`.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: ezsp
usb_path:
  description: Path to the serial device for the radio.
  required: true
  type: string
baudrate:
  description: Baud rate of the serial device.
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 57600
database_path:
  description: _Full_ path to the database which will keep persistent network data.
  required: true
  type: string
enable_quirks:
  description: Enable quirks mode for devices where manufacturers didn't follow specs.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: true
{% endconfiguration %}

To add new devices to the network, call the `permit` service on the `zha` domain. Do this by clicking the Service icon in Developer tools and typing `zha.permit` in the **Service** dropdown box. Next, follow the device instructions for adding, scanning or factory reset.

## Adding devices

Go to the **Configuration** page and select the **ZHA** integration that was added by the configuration steps above.

Click on **ADD DEVICES** to start a scan for new devices.

Reset your Zigbee devices according to the device instructions provided by the manufacturer (e.g.,  turn on/off lights up to 10 times, switches usually have a reset button/pin).

## Troubleshooting

### General tips

Adding a USB extension cable will move your USB stick away from the computer you've connected it to. This can reduce interference, and improve your range.

Add an external antenna to your coordinator, and position the antenna away from the computer.

Ensure that any WiFi router/access point, WiFi USB stick, Z-Wave stick, or RF433 stick are as far away as you can get them (preferably at least one meter if you can). This will also reduce interference.

Check the WiFi channels in use, to see if your router/access point is now talking over your Zigbee mesh. If so change the channel of the WiFi access point and lock it. If you have to change the channel of your Zigbee mesh then you'll have to re-pair your devices.

Add more routers between the problem devices and the next nearest router.

If you're still stuck at that point, head over the #zigbee channel on the [Home Assistant Discord server](https://discord.gg/c5DvZ4e), or the [Zigbee section of the community forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/c/configuration/zigbee).

### ZHA exception and deviation handling

Zigbee devices that deviate from or do not fully conform to the standard specifications set by the [Zigbee Alliance](https://www.zigbee.org) may require the development of custom [ZHA Device Handlers](https://github.com/dmulcahey/zha-device-handlers) (ZHA custom quirks handler implementation) to for all their functions to work properly with the ZHA integration in Home Assistant. These ZHA Device Handlers for Home Assistant can thus be used to parse custom messages to and from Zigbee devices.

The custom quirks implementations for zigpy implemented as ZHA Device Handlers are a similar concept to that of [Hub-connected Device Handlers for the SmartThings Classics platform](https://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/device-type-developers-guide/) as well that of [Zigbee-Herdsman Converters / Zigbee-Shepherd Converters as used by Zigbee2mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/how_tos/how_to_support_new_devices.html), meaning they are virtual representation of a physical device that expose additional functionality that is not provided out-of-the-box by the existing integration between these platforms. See [Device Specifics](#Device-Specifics) for details.

### Add Philips Hue bulbs that have previously been added to another bridge

Philips Hue bulbs that have previously been added to another bridge won't show up during search. You have to restore your bulbs back to factory settings first. To achieve this, you basically have the following options.

#### Philips Hue Dimmer Switch

Using a Philips Hue Dimmer Switch is probably the easiest way to factory-reset your bulbs. For this to work, the remote doesn't have to be paired with your previous bridge.

1. Turn on your Hue bulb you want to reset
2. Hold the Dimmer Switch near your bulb (< 10 cm)
3. Press and hold the (I)/(ON) and (O)/(OFF) buttons of the Dimmer Switch for about 10 seconds until your bulb starts to blink
4. Your bulb should stop blinking and eventually turning on again. At the same time, a green light on the top left of your remote indicates that your bulb has been successfully reset to factory settings.

#### hue-thief

Follow the instructions on [https://github.com/vanviegen/hue-thief/](https://github.com/vanviegen/hue-thief/) (EZSP-based Zigbee USB stick required)

### ZHA Start up issue with Home-Assistant Docker/Hass.io installs on linux hosts

On Linux hosts ZHA can fail to start during HA startup or restarts because the Zigbee USB device is being claimed by the host's modemmanager service. To fix this disable the modemmanger on the host system.

To remove modemmanager from an Debian/Ubuntu host run this command:

```bash
sudo apt-get purge modemmanager
```

### Can't connect to USB device and using Docker

If you are using Docker and can't connect, you most likely need to forward your device from the host machine to the Docker instance. This can be achieved by adding the device mapping to the end of the startup string or ideally using docker compose.

#### Docker Compose

Install Docker-Compose for your platform (linux - `sudo apt-get install docker-compose`).

Create a `docker-compose.yml` with the following data:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  homeassistant:
    # customisable name
    container_name: home-assistant
    
    # must be image for your platform, this is the rpi3 variant
    image: homeassistant/raspberrypi3-homeassistant
    volumes:
      - <DIRECTORY HOLDING HOME ASSISTANT CONFIG FILES>:/config
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    devices:
      # your usb device forwarding to the docker image
      - /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
```
